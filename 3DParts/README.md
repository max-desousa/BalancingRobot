For this project i need some 3d printed parts.

I want to make a bracket that will hold the stepper motors.
This is intended to prevent a quick gluing of the motors to the structure. 
(Reusability of parts is important to me)

Also, I don't know that I like what I had previously purchased for wheels
We may make some special designed wheels to simplify coupling the wheels to
motors.
